 <br><br>→ The outsourcing of IT services and infrastructure, making them accessible remotely via the internet.<br>→ The internet is the infrastructure, and the world wide web is a service that runs on it.<br><br><br>These are used by a range of end-users. They can be accessed through a digital device (with internet). A public cloud is usually hosted by one cloud provider, e.g., Amazon Web Service, OneDrive.<br><br>These are used by a specific organisation and can be hosted on site or remotely. Access to a private cloud is restricted by a firewall managed by the organisation. A private cloud requires the organisation to install the hardware, software and networking components.<br><br>This is a cloud designed for and used by a group of organisations in a particular sector. For example, the financial sector may use a community cloud to transfer money between banks and process credit cards.<br><br>This is the 'best of both worlds' and incorporates the both private and public clouds. For example, an organisation can utilise some services on the public cloud, but has a private cloud for sensitive services or data.<br><br>There are three commonly used delivery models:<br>
<br>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
<br>Platform as a Service (PaaS)
<br>Software as a Service (SaaS)
<br><br><br><br>Runtime → The length of time a computer program takes to run.<br>
Middleware → Software that connects the front-end to the back-end]]></description><link>course\business\cloud-environments.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Course/Business/Cloud environments.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 19:43:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Data]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>
<br>Human generated
<br>Artificial intelligence/machine learning
<br>Sensors
<br>Transactional data
<br><br>Knowledge is a combination of information and a person’s experience and intuition<br><br>This is data which has been organised and given analysis and context<br><br>This is the raw numbers and figures which lack any kind of organisation<br><br>
<br>Companies that do not understand the importance of data management are less likely to survive
<br>A company’s data is its most valuable asset
<br>It gives valuable insights to customer needs and user behaviours
<br><br>
<br>Often in the format of a hierarchical tree structure
<br>Easier for the end user to locate files
<br>Should be a logical structure
<br><br>
<br>Process of changing unorganised and raw data into data that can be analysed, therefore making it useful.
<br><br>
<br>Discovery

<br>Understand the data fully


<br>Structure

<br>Data must be structured to ensure it is accessible


<br>Cleansing

<br>Data sets can include data that does not meet the requirements, causing a skew in the analysis


<br>Enrichment

<br>Externally collected data sets will most likely not meet the specified needs.
<br>Two or more data sets will need to be combined


<br>Validation

<br>Checking the reliability, quality and safety of the data.
<br>This involved checking the data to ensure it is complete


<br>Publishing

<br>When the data has been wrangled, the data is ready to be analysed and produce output
<br>e.g., textual or graphical


<br><br>All data systems have the same basic functions<br>
<br>Input

<br>Collection of raw data


<br>Search

<br>Carry out searches on data


<br>Save

<br>Data that has been input into the system must be stored for reuse


<br>Integrate

<br>Different data types/formats can be integrated into a single location


<br>Organise (index)

<br>Saved data can be organised, e.g., through indexing


<br>Output

<br>The processed and analysed data can be output to the relevant people


<br>Feedback loop

<br>Output that is returned to, usually senior management, to evaluate various processes


<br><br>There are two main types of errors that can be made on data entry<br>
<br>Transcription

<br>Occurs when copying data from the source e.g., from a user.
<br>e.g., the user may type the wrong key on the keyboard


<br>Transposition

<br>Occurs when two letters or numbers have been reversed


<br><br>Validation: Checks the data being entered is reasonable and meets pre-set rules<br>Verification: Checks if the data entered is identical to the source.<br><br>An entity relationship diagram is used to define how a system will be implemented, this is done through the use of entity's and relationships.<br>Primary key: A field in a table that uniquely identifies each record<br>Foreign key: Used to link tables together, a foreign key references a primary key in a different table<br><br>
<br>Contains data about the data that will be included in the database
<br>→ metadata
<br><br>
<br>Volume

<br>The amount of data generated each second, minute and hour


<br>Variety

<br>Considers where the data has come from and in what form


<br>Velocity

<br>The speed at which the data is being generated in real time


<br>Variability

<br>How quickly and to what extent, the data being processed is changing


<br>Value

<br>The meaning of the data after processing and analysis
<br>How much the results meet the goals


<br>Veracity

<br>How trustworthy is the data


<br>Data assurance: The data must have a high level of reliability and quality.<br>Data redundancy: Occurs when the same piece of data is stored two or more times on a system<br>Qualitative: Text/Descriptive based data<br>Quantitative: Numerical based data<br><br>
<br>All data should be gathered, entered and maintained in the same way with no bias
<br>Data must be kept securely
<br>Big data: Very large data set that can be analysed to produce information<br><br>
<br>Data warehouse

<br>Central collection of key data, in a pre-defined format.
<br>Used to make business-critical and evidence-based decisions
<br>Subject to data cleaning


<br>Data lake

<br>Hold data in an unstructured way+
<br>Stored in raw state
<br>It may not be processed
<br>Takes from all sources in any data type


<br><br>
<br>Data about data
<br>Can be classified in three main ways:

<br>Administrative
<br>Descriptive
<br>Structural


<br>1 → Provides administrative instructions about a file, such as any restrictions to be placed on the file.<br>2 → Relates to how the data is identified, could include titles, dates or keywords. (referred to as<br>metatags on a website)<br>3 → Structural describes how a digital asset is arranged or structured, an obvious example is a data dictionary<br><br>
<br>Application Programming Interface
<br>Enables users to manage, access and use data across a range of platforms
<br>Main advantage is users do not need to create accounts for multiple websites
<br>Users can create many websites using an API whilst only requiring one log-in credential
<br>Uses JSON to send and receive requests
<br>API sends a user’s request to a digital system, and the system sends back a response
<br>e.g., a user adds a product to their shopping basket. The API will tell the website that a product has been added to the basket and the website puts the product into the user’s virtual basket. The basket is then updated.
<br><br><br>
<br>Data that is stored and not moving
<br><br>
<br>Data that is being actively used and/or processed by a user or digital system
<br><br>
<br>Data when moving from one location to another, this includes moving inside a network
<br>Data in motion is less secure than the other two

 <br><br>User experience is the most important factor for many people. If the hardware does not give the user a positive experience, then no one would choose it. For example:<br>An elderly person wanting a mobile phone, may likely want a simple to use phone, large keys and a clear screen.<br>This includes availability. Hardware must have options for people who may have disabilities such as colour blind, or poor vision.<br>Performance must be suitable to the product. If a piece of hardware is slow, it provides a negative experience and damages the products reputation.<br><br>
<br>Camera Mouse head tracking
<br>Zoom text screen magnifier
<br>Braille note taker
<br>Braille mobile phone
<br>Scanning pen
<br>Big keys keyboard
<br><br><br>
<br>Two or more things that need to interact together do so properly
<br>Chose a system that is compatible with current hardware
<br><br>
<br>How useful the output of a task if based on the resources used
<br><br>
<br>Chose hardware that matches the budget with allocation for maintenance
<br>Balance the cost of hardware in a machine E.g. don’t get a really expensive GPU and a poor CPU
<br><br><br>
<br>Read instruction manuals
<br>Observe current systems
<br>Conduct interviews
<br>Advantages and disadvantages of the system you want to get
<br>Feasibility study
<br><br>
<br>Select hardware, software and OS
<br>Design interface
<br>Determine file structure
<br>Test plans
<br><br>
<br>Correct errors
<br>Implement updates
<br>Make improvements
<br><br>
<br>Does the system perform as expected?
<br>Can it be improved further?
<br>Are there any unexpected benefits or problems?

 <br><br>Businesses use networks to connect together digital devices, wirelessly or with cables, so that they can communicate and share resources with each other<br><br><br><br>
<br>A hub broadcasts to all connected devices, whereas a switch directs to one or more devices
<br><br><br><br>
<br>SSID → Service Set Identifier; a unique name identifying the name of the wireless network
<br><br>
<br>Needs be be able to increase in size without major re-configuration
<br><br>
<br>Be able to handle high volumes of demands

<br>Ensure sufficient access points so that if one is overloaded, the network will focus traffic in the direction of another access point


<br><br>
<br>Ability to measure the performance of the network
<br><br>
<br>All networks must mitigate against threats

<br>Application filtering is used to protect from potential malicious threats


<br><br>
<br>Guarantee the performance levels of applications that are critical to the functioning of the business.
<br>Applications that are high priority, are therefore prioritised
<br><br><br>
<br>Measurement of how much data can be transferred from one point to another during a specific time period
<br>Larger the available bandwidth the greater amount of data can be sent and received across the network
<br><br>
<br>Measure of the time taken to transmit data from one point to another
<br><br>
<br>Distance → The response time will be longer based on the distance between the client and server e.g., another country
<br>Transmission medium → Wired has lower latency than wireless, radio signals degrade more over time
<br>Propagation delay → The length of time it takes data packets to travel from the device to the server
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br>Seven layers
<br>Designed to show how a network system communicates and operates
<br>Split into two groups

<br>Lower &amp; Upper layer


<br><br><br>
<br>Closest layer to the user
<br>Uses protocols such as → FTP, HTTP,
<br><br>
<br>Translates data into a suitable format so that it can be understood by the application
<br>Uses protocols such as → JPEG, MPEG
<br><br>
<br>This allow applications running on different computers to communicate with each other.
<br>E.g., Establish session, manage data transfer, tear down the session
<br>Uses protocols such as → NFS, SQL
<br><br>
<br>Responsible for ensuring reliable data delivery so that packets arrive error free and without loss.
<br>Uses protocols such as → TCP, UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

 <br><br>→ Remote servers accessed via the internet that store, manage and process data<br><br>→ This is the technology that enables a single, physical hardware system to be separated into multiple simulated environments.<br>Software know as a hypervisor e.g., VirtualBox, connects to the hardware and splits one system into separate systems known as Virtual Machines (VMs).<br>The hardware that is equipped with a hypervisor is called the host, and the VMs are called guests.<br><br><br><br>→ Increased security; a VM manager can control the guest’s programs. This mitigates the risk for harmful operations being carried out.<br>→ Management; the sharing and aggregation of data can all be managed from a central server.<br>→ Isolation; guests each have a separate environment . This reduces the risk of harmful operations and potential for collisions with other software.<br>→ Portability; a guest is packaged into a virtual image , this means it can be safely moved and executed on top of different VMs.<br><br>Benefits<br>→ Efficient use of hardware; many organisations only use a fraction of their hardware effectively, with virtualisation, multiple instances of hardware can be created and therefore increase effectiveness of the resources.<br>→ Continuous availability; virtualisation allows access at any time. A virtual instance can be moved from one server location to another without having to shut down the process. No data is losing during the migration process.<br>→ Simplified and faster setup; setting up systems can be complex and time-consuming. With virtualisation, an organisation can be up and running within minutes.<br>Drawbacks<br>→ Cost; initial setup can be costly as high performance hardware and software can be expensive.<br>→ Reduces performance; resources are shared. As there may be multiple users performing complex tasks, the overall performance can be reduces.<br>→ Security risks; a single compromised virtual machine could affect the others on the same host.<br>→ Downtime; hardware failures can impact multiple virtual machines on the same server.]]></description><link>course\business\virtualisation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Course/Business/Virtualisation.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 15:17:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vulnerability]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>A flexible method of production
<br>Each batch goes through all stages of production together
<br>Quality control can be carried out between batches
<br>Good for maintaining sensible levels of inventory
<br>Can be lots of downtime between batches


<br>Production equipment can be altered in response to changing needs
<br>Done through the use of a program
<br><br>
<br>Produce various combinations of products without having to separate them into batches
<br>Expensive
<br>Reduces down-time as re-programming is not needed
<br>E.g. Make 2 red then 4 yellow then 10 blue
<br><br>
<br>Reduced human labour<br>

<br>Consistency in quality<br>

<br>Fewer risks of human error<br>

<br>Improved health and safety<br>

 <br>The top-down approach in software development is&nbsp;a method of designing and building a system by starting with a high-level design and then progressively refining the design with increasing levels of detail. This approach involves breaking down a large, complex problem or system into smaller, more manageable pieces, and then working on each piece individually.<br><br>
<br>High-level design: Top-down approach begins with a high-level understanding of the system’s requirements and functionality.
<br>Decomposition: The system is broken down into smaller more manageable modules which are designed and implemented separately.
<br>Stepwise refinement: Each module is refined in detail
<br><br>
<br>Easier to understand
<br>Improved organization
<br>Reduced complexity
<br>Faster development
<br><br>
<br>Risk of oversimplification (the high-level design may not capture all the complexities of the system)
<br>Difficulty in handling unexpected issues (top-down approach has a lack of flexibility)
<br>Less creative
<br><br>
<br>C
<br>COBOL
<br>FORTRAN
<br><br>
<br>Click me!

<br>The top-down approach goes from the general to the specific, whereas the bottom-up approach moves from the specific to the general.
<br>During the top-down approach, integration happens after the high-level design is completed, whereas during bottom-up approach, the integration occurs as each component is developed and tested.
<br>Top-down approach uses decomposition, which is taking the high level design and breaking down the system into more detail components…
<br>Whereas Bottom-Up approach uses composition which is starting with the low-level components or modules first.
